## cookie-stand


I built an app that calculates the amount of sales for 5 differnt store locations. The min customers per hour(CPH), max CPH, and the avg number of cookies purchased per customer were calculated together and displayed on the table (sales.index). So far we have utlized JS Constructor Functions and basic DOM manipulation to create this project.

### Reflections and Comments
* Utilzing JS Constructor Functions is a great way to shorten your code. This also makes things easier to read for other devlopers when teaming up on a project.
